# UFO Sightings

## Overview of Project

The purpose of this project is to create a website that displays UFO sightings data and allow for users to custom filter results on the sightings they are looking for.

## Results

Upon opening the website, all UFO sightings data are displayed intially. The user applies filters on the results by typing in their search criteria on the filter search box, where they can input any (or all) the input boxes available. Upon successful input, the website will refresh and filter the results the user specified as per their input.

## Summary

One of the drawbacks of the current website design is it is not dummy proof for users, where they may misspell/mistype the input boxes which causes the filtering to fail. A potential solution is to make a drop-down box on the filters based on what is available in the data e.g. drop-down box for country only contains us as the filter option. Another potential improvement is to allow users to download the data directly e.g. have the data.js file available as a json, so they can perform further analysis.
